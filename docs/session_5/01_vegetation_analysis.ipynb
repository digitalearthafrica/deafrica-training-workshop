    "We saw how the index allowed easier analysis of Earth observation data, and allowed comparison across time periods. However, it also had limitations. In our NDVI map of the fields around Mansoura, Egypt, we saw there were areas which constantly had low NDVI. We would need to provide additional context to know those were urbanised areas.\n",
