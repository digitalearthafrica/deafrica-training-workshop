    "A Web Map Service (WMS) is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard that allows users to remotely access georeferenced map images via secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS) requests.\n",

    "DE Africa provides two types of maps services:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Web Map Service (WMS) – A standard protocol for serving georeferenced map images over the internet that are generated from a map server using data from a GIS database. It is important to note that with a WMS, you are essentially getting an image of geospatial data (i.e. JPG, GIF, PNG file). While this has its uses, it is an image only, and therefore does not contain any of the underlying geospatial data that was used to create the image.\n",
    "* Web Coverage Service (WCS) – A standard protocol for serving coverage data which returns data with its original semantics (instead of just pictures) which may be interpreted, extrapolated, etc., and not just portrayed. Essentially, a WCS can be thought of as the raw geospatial raster data behind an image. Using a WCS, you can pull the raw raster information you need to perform further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to give a quick summarisation, a WMS is simply an image of a map. You can almost think of this like taking a screenshot of Google Maps. A WCS is the raw raster data, so for example, if you are working with a WCS containing Landsat imagery, you can effectively chunk off the piece you are interested in and download the full multispectral image at the spatial resolution of the original image. The beauty of these services is that you can grab only the information you need. So, rather than retrieving a file that contains the data you are seeking and possibly much more, you can confine your download to only your area of interest, allowing you to get what you need and no more.\n",
