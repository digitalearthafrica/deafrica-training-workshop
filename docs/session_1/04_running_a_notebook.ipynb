More detail on Python can be found in [Extra session: Python basics](../python_basics/index.rst), which is an **optional** module that provides greater context into common Python commands used in the Digital Earth Africa platform. It is recommended to first follow the steps below to set up a folder in the Sandbox environment before completing the Python basics module."
