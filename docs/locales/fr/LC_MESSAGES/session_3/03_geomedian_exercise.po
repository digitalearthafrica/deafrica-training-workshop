"In this section, we will re-run the notebook from the previous section, "
"and extend it to create a geomedian composite. First, we will open and "
"run our ``Geomedian_composite.ipynb`` notebook. This will ensure it loads"
" the Sentinel-2 cloud-masked data. Then, we will use a function called "
"``xr_geomedian`` to calculate geomedians. This will allow us to plot a "
"cloud-free geomedian composite image."
