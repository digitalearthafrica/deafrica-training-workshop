Session 1.5: Python basics
=======================

This section gives an introduction to Python, a popular programming language. Python is used in the Digital Earth Africa Sandbox platform to extract data, perform analysis, and display results.

This section is intended to provide training course participants with more context around the common commands we use in the Sandbox. In particular, it targets functions specific to geospatial data analysis. The training course can be completed without reviewing this section, but users may find it helpful to better understand some of the code in the later sections.

Like other sections of this Digital Earth Africa course, it should take around 2 hours to complete. It is not intended as a comprehensive Python training course. General Python instruction can be found on websites such as Coursera. We do not endorse any particular training course and urge interested users to find a course which aligns with their needs.

Users already confident using Python are welcome to skip this section, although we suggest looking over the content to make sure it is familiar to you.
