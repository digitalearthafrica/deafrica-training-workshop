    "Satelllite products are datasets output from satellites orbiting Earth. These datasets have undergone some pre-processing by the satellite operators, but are otherwise 'raw' data, measuring quantities such as reflectance, radiation and surface temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "These products are fundamental to Earth observation analytics. They are distinguished by a few key attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Spatial resolution (how detailed):** Spatial resolution refers to the pixel size of the satellite product; that is, the smallest thing the satellite can 'see'. A higher resolution means a smaller pixel size, which means finer details can be distinguished in the image. Higher resolution is always superior, but resolution is limited by the satellite hardware. \n",
    "* **Temporal resolution (how often):** Digital Earth Africa currently uses satellite products derived from satellites in a polar orbit. Satellites in polar orbits pass over the poles of the Earth on each orbit, but each orbit also passes over different areas than the previous orbit. This means most parts of the world are captured by the satellite imagery, but are only revisited once or twice a month. Temporal resolution can be improved if a product uses more than one satellite &mdash; this is the case for the Sentinel-2 program, which has two dedicated satellites. \n",
    "* **Spectral resolution (how versatile):** Spectral resolution refers to the sensors on the satellite. The sensors are calibrated to collect measurements in certain wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The sensors are classified into 'bands' (sometimes called 'channels') by wavelength. Bands are often named by the characteristics of the wavelength range they cover, such as 'red', 'green', or 'near-infrared'. Each satellite has its own defined set of bands and bandwidths &mdash; they are not standardised. However, as a rule, the more bands a product has, the more versatile it is. This is because different bands are useful for idenitfying different features on Earth."
