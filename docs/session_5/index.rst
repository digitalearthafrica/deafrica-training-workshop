Session 5: Vegetation Analyses
==============================

In this session, we will combine many of the techniques you've learned during the training course to build a complete case study. This is where you have a question in mind that you want to answer, load and analyse the appropriate data, then draw conclusions to try and answer your question.

This session will focus on case studies related to vegetation. First, we'll cover the available vegetation case studies on the Sandbox, as well as how to structure your own case study. Then, you'll work through building your own case study to detect changes in vegetation over time.
