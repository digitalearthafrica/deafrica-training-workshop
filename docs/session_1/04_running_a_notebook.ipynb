    "## Learning Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is an interactive coding environment. The name ‘Jupyter’ comes from Julia, Python and R, which are all programming languages that are used in scientific computing. Jupyter started as a purely Python-based environment, called iPython, but there has been rapid progress over the last few years, and now many large organisations like Netflix1 are using the system to analyse data.\n",
    "Since the ODC is a Python library, the workshop will cover working with Earth observation data in Python-based notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explore a basic notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The first exercise is to explore a very basic notebook. The goal is to understand the key features of notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve used Jupyter before, you may want to skip this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the ‘Beginners_guide’ folder, and then open the file named ‘01_Jupyter_notebooks.ipynb’.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./dea1A.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn about the notebook, read through the text in the notebook and run each code cell step (using ‘shift + enter’). Feel free to change the code sections to explore how it works.\n",
    "Note that when the section to the side of a cell is showing an asterisk, that means it is running. This is most important when running a data load that may take more than a few seconds\n",
    "The next image displays an executed cell.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Do it Yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity will demonstrate how to run one of the Digital Earth Africa Sandbox notebooks.  The notebook is a real world example showing how to measure crop health. \n",
    "\n",
    "Find the the notebook named ‘Crop_health.ipynb’ from the ‘Real_World_Examples’ folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./img1.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, right-click on the notebook to create a copy so that you can modify the original freely.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./img00.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "If necessary, you can restore the origiginal notebook from the newly created notebook called 'Crop_health-Copy1.ipynb'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./img1.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this notebook comes pre-run, restart the kernel and Clear all Outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./img2.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we load the functions load_crophealth_data and run_crophealth_app:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./img3.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pick a Study Site\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have to provide the area of interest using latitude, longitude, and a buffer, which describes how many square degrees to load around the set latitude and longitude values. You can use some of the provided values, or provide your own after checking that the data are available in the Digital Earth Africa Explorer.  \n",
    "The notebook will turn this into a bounding box, which is passed to the datacube load command. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./img4.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Pass the parameters into the load_crophealth_data function in order to load the data and run the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./img5.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The load_crophealth_data function goes through a number of steps.  It identifies the available LANDSAT8 data over the last two years, then masks the bad quality pixels such as cloud and cloud shadow.  After the masking step, the function only keeps images where more than half the pixels are good.  Finally, it calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and returns the data.  The returned data are stored in the dataset object.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./img6.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we can see the function identified 30 observations over the last 2 years, then kept and loaded 19 that kept the quality requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run the Crop Health App\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading the data, we can visualize the health of various fields using the run_crophealth_health function with the dataset we loaded as long as the lat, long and buffer parameters which define our area of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "When run, the function starts an interactive app.  On the left we have an interactive app which will allow you to draw a polygon around a field of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./img7.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The map in this app shows an ESRI basemap which is higher resolution than the LANDSAT8 data used to calculate the NDVI index.  The purpose of the map is to guide you in drawing field boundaries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the polygon is drawn aroudn a field, it will display the history of the NDVI index for that field:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./img8.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The cycles in the graph are likely related to the growth and harvesting events.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to draw multiple polygons and compare the vegetation index over time of different fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./img9.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool can be used to examine differences in the health of the crops, which could support targeted fertilization.  On a larger scale, an adapted version of this tool could also be used to help estimate crop yield, which may help with understanding food security.  \n"
