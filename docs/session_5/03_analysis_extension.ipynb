    "Beside some minor differences like (1) the other vegetation change detection notebook visualizing the loaded data and its spectral index values whereas the exercise does not, (2) the notebooks having different code for selecting the baseline and postbaseline data (the other vegetation change detection notebook does not use *slice()*, unlike our exerise), or (3) the other vegetation change detection notebook exporting some data as TIFF files, these notebooks are mostly the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is the use of a statistical test in the other vegetation change detection notebook. In the **Test for change** subsection of the **Perform hypothesis test** section, the [t-statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-statistic) (**t_stat**) and [p-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value) (**p_val**) are calculated for each pixel - comparing the distributions of spectral index values between the 2 time periods (baseline and post-baseline) for each pixel. The t-statistic here is essentially a measure of the difference between the distribution of values for each pixel, and the p-value is an estimate of the probability that such a t-statistic (difference between distributions) would occur if the 2 distributions (baseline and post-baseline, for each pixel) were sampled from the same population - that is, if the baseline and post-baseline time periods had the same true distribution of spectral index values. In this case, the true distribution would be the spectral index values of clear Landsat 8 data for all times, not just once every 16 days (continuous spectral index values across time)."
