Session 3: Composites
=======================

In this session, we will explore the advantages of having satellite data available over a long period of time. We can fill in missing or bad data from one day with data from another day. This creates a complete image known as a **composite**. The most scientifically rigorous way of combining data is to use a **geomedian**. 

First, we will introduce composites and geomedians. Then, the exercise will walk through removing cloudy data points from our datasets, and show you how to produce cloud-free geomedian composite images.
