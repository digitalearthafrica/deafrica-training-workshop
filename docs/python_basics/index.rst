Extra session: Python basics
==============================

**Completion of this section is optional. All six DE Africa Training Course sessions can be successfully completed without this module.**

This section gives an introduction to Python, a popular programming language. Python is used in the Digital Earth Africa Sandbox platform to extract data, perform analysis, and display results.

This section is intended to provide training course participants with more context around the common commands we use in the Sandbox. In particular, it targets functions specific to geospatial data analysis. The training course can be completed without reviewing this section, but users may find it helpful to better understand some of the code in the later sections.

The Python basics module consists of five separate lessons. You can come back to the lessons at any time. They are not intended as a comprehensive Python training course. We do not endorse any particular generic Python training course and urge interested users to find a course which aligns with their needs.

Users who are short on time or already confident using Python are welcome to skip this section, although we suggest looking over the content to make sure it is familiar to you.

**Structure of each Python basics lesson page**
 - Brief overview of tutorial contents
 - Tutorial file download: user to download and open the file in the Sandbox as instructed. The tutorial notebook is interactive
 - Tutorial walkthrough (not interactive), to be followed in tandem with the downloaded file
 - Exercises to check understanding
 - Conclusion
 
 An internet connection will be required to use the interactive tutorial notebooks and exercises on the Sandbox platform.
