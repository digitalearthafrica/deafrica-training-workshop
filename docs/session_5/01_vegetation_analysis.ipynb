    "\n",
    "The index made the Earth observation data easier to analyse, and allowed comparison across time periods. In our NDVI map of a cropping field, we could see there were seasonal variations over the quarterly geomedians. However, that information by itself provides little context for further use. Why are we looking at this field? Do the results fit what we were expecting to see? What can we use this information for?\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis method you apply to Digital Earth Africa data will depend on **what you want to know**. Now that we know more about the strengths and limitations of vegetation indices, we can use them to form the basis of a complete case study that informs a user of a real-world outcome.\n",

This section outlines some common goals of vegetation analysis, and provides references to examples of case study notebooks. The following sections will walk through a tutorial on how to construct a notebook on vegetation change detection."
