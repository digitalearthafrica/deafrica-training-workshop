Session 6: Water Analyses
=========================

In this session, we will continue to combine many of the techniques you've learned during the training course to build a complete case study. This is where you have a question in mind that you want to answer, load and analyse the appropriate data, then draw conclusions to try and answer your question.

This session will focus on case studies related to water. First, we'll cover the available water and coastal case studies on the Sandbox, as well as covering the **Water Observations from Space (WOfS)** dataset. Then, you'll work through building your own case study to monitor water extent over time.
