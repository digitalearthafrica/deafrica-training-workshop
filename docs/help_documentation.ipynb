    "The Digital Earth Africa Sandbox, by default, will load several folders containing helpful notebooks and source code. They are essential to the Sandbox's operation, so do not delete or move any of the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Beginner's Guide notebooks cover similar material to the explanations and exercises in this workshop series. However, they also provides more in-depth detail on how to perform data extraction and analysis. The Beginner's Guide notebooks, along with the 'frequently used code' notebooks, are a great reference tool.\n",

    "The **Beginners_guide** folder contains step-by-step tutorials to help you become more familiar with the Digital Earth Africa Sandbox. The tutorials contain background information and context, as well as code and data examples and explanations. The guide covers a range of basic Sandbox functions, including how to load data and plot it. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Suggested activity:** Read and follow examples in the Beginner's Guide notebooks, starting with `01_Jupyter_notebooks.ipynb`. This can be done interactively (recommended), as detailed in [running a notebook](./session_1/04_running_a_notebook.ipynb). Open the file and from the horizontal menu bar select **Kernel -> Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs**, then follow instructions in the notebook. \n",

    "Take your time &mdash; it is not necessary to review all of the notebooks in one sitting. If you are new to Python coding, there will be a fair amount of content. Some of it will be covered in subsequent sessions of this workshop series. "

For example, want to calculate the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)? You could set up your own formula &mdash; but it would be faster and easier to use the NDVI function as shown in `Calculating_band_indices.ipynb`. How about drawing a contour line between water and land? Check out `Contour_extraction.ipynb`. There are many useful tips and tricks in the **Frequently_used_code** folder.\n",
