In this session, we will construct a new case study, focussing on water. This will involve learning to use the Water Observations from Space (WOfS) dataset, which is discussed more below."

If `dc` is a `datacube.Datacube` object, then `dc.list_measurements().loc[\"ga_ls8c_wofs_2\", \"water\"]['flags_definition']` will show information regarding the significance of different values for this measurement. That information shows that the classification `'wet'` has `'values': {'128': True}`, so if we have data from the product **ga_ls8c_wofs_2** in a variable called `water_ds`, then we can find which pixels WOfS has classified as water with `water_ds.water == 128`.\n",
