"In this session, we will explore the advantages of having satellite data "
"available over a long period of time. We can fill in missing or bad data "
"from one day with data from another day. This creates a complete image "
"known as a **composite**. The most scientifically rigorous way of "
"combining data is to use a **geomedian**."

"First, we will introduce composites and geomedians. Then, the exercise "
