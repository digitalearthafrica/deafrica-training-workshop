"When we want to make a single image that represents a period of time from"
" satellite data, we use a method known as compositing. This notebook will"
" help you to experiement with two similar (but subtly different) "
"compositing methods, known as the ``median`` and ``geomedian``."

"In this example, you have a dataset of Earth observation satellite data. "
"It contains the red, green, and blue bands, which are used to generate "
"colour images. We will focus on a single pixel that has data for 3 "
"different timesteps. We can composite (combine) these 3 timesteps into "
"one using a statistical composition method such as ``median`` or "
"``geomedian``."
