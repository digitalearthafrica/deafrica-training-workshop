    "# Running a Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is an interactive coding environment. The name ‘Jupyter’ comes from Julia, Python and R, which are all programming languages that are used in scientific computing. Jupyter started as a purely Python-based environment, called iPython, but there has been rapid progress over the last few years, and now many large organisations like Netflix1 are using the system to analyse data.\n",
    "Since the ODC is a Python library, the workshop will cover working with Earth observation data in Python-based notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explore a basic notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The first exercise is to explore a very basic notebook. The goal is to understand the key features of notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve used Jupyter before, you may want to skip this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the ‘Tutorial’ folder, and then open the file named ‘01_Jupyter_notebooks.ipynb’.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./dea1.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn about the notebook, read through the text in the notebook and run each code cell step (using ‘shift + enter’). Feel free to change the code sections to explore how it works.\n",
    "Note that when the section to the side of a cell is showing an asterisk, that means it is running. This is most important when running a data load that may take more than a few seconds\n",
    "The next image displays an executed cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./dea2.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Apps\n",
    "This example makes use of functions, which is where more complex code has been wrapped up into simple expressions. In this document, these functions are referred to as ‘apps’. The ‘apps’ make it simple to change an analysis, as they provide ways to interact with the analysis that don’t require changes to the underlying code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agriculture App\n",
    "From the ‘Case_Studies’ folder, load the notebook named ‘Agriculture.ipynb’.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./dea3.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Read through the notes at the top of the notebook, and then run the first two cells of code. The first cell imports the required Python functions, which you can examine if you’d like to know how they work. The second cell a runs one of the functions, which will load some data using the ODC. You should see some information logged by this function as it runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./dea4.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the next cell, with the ‘run_agriculture_app(dataset_sentinel2)’ function in it. This will display an interactive map with a red box showing the area we loaded data for.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./dea5.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this interactive map, draw polygons to delineate two distinct fields by using the ‘Draw a polygon’ tool .\n",
    "After drawing both polygons, look at the graph produced. Identify the differences between paddocks. The graph displays the normalised difference vegetation index2, which indicates the presence of vegetation. High values (approaching one) indicate healthy vegetation, while low values (approaching negative one) are often cloud or snow. Continue delineating a few more fields and see if there are any differences between them.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mining App\n",
    "\n",
    "To try out another ‘app’ based notebook, load the notebook named ‘Mining.ipynb’ from the ‘Case_Studies’ folder. This is an optional exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./dea7_5.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",

    "\n",
    "### Do it Yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity uses a code-based (rather than app-based) notebook, to demonstrate how the ODC Python API works. This will be a simple example of picking a study site in Australia, loading data for that area and plotting bands into the red, green and blue channels of an image.\n",
    "Load the notebook named ‘02_Do_it_yourself.ipynb’ from the ‘Tutorial’ folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./dea8.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, read through the notebook and follow the steps. Feel free to run the cells, as this will work for the example study sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pick a Study Site\n",
    "\n",
    "To set a study site, provide the latitude and longitude for the centre of an area, and the notebook will turn this into a bounding box, which is passed to the datacube load command. To get the latitude and longitude for any area in Australia, visit Google maps (https://maps.google.com), find somewhere that looks interesting, and then left-click on the map. A small info panel will pop up with some information including coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./dea9.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Paste these coordinates into square brackets in the first code cell. These coordinates will be used to create a bounding box to load data for the study site.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./dea10.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the datacube load, run the cells below the coordinates cell, including the one with the datacube load command. You will need to set the box size in the second code cell otherwise you’ll get the following error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./dea12.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After the data is loaded, run the cell below. This cell calls the ‘dataset’ object created in the previous cell, which will return some information about it.\n",
    "Specifically, ‘dataset’ is an ‘XArray’ object containing the loaded data. It has three dimensions: time, longitude (x), and latitude (y). For the Dead Dog Creek example, with a box size of 0.05 degrees, the ‘dataset’ should contain something like 8 timesteps, 1194 cells in longitude and 1201 cells in latitude. This information comes from the ‘Dimensions’ heading.\n",
    "Each timestep is an occasion that the satellite captured an image. The satellite also captures several different spectral ‘bands’, which are listed under the ‘Data variables’ heading. The returned variables correspond to the ‘measurements’ requested as part of the load command in the previous cell. Here, the ‘nbar’ word refers to processed data, which means the data has been adjusted to Australian conditions (this is called ‘analysis ready data’).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./dea13.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualize the Site\n",
    "After loading data, it is important to visualise it. Fill in the missing values and then run the cell under the heading ‘Plotting data’. To get more experience with interacting with Python code, change the timestep being plotted (should be a number between 0 and one fewer than the number of timesteps), and the band combination (should be a list of three data variables that belong to the dataset: [‘var_1’, ‘var_2’, ‘var_3’]). As a stretch goal, include more bands in the datacube load command, and plot other measurements4, such as Coastal Aerosol.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./dea14.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is formatted by a function called ‘rgb()’ which takes the ‘dataset’ object, as well as the bands and time step chosen above.\n",
    "Finally, the plotting code constructs the figure and displays the image created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./dea15.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you can change the title of the image, the font size, or axis labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Save and Download Data\n",
    "Once you have a site and timestep worth saving, run the next cell to write it out as a GeoTIFF, which can be loaded into a desktop GIS (e.g. QGIS) for further analysis. To download the rendered image, navigate to the Jupyter folder and find the image, right-click it, and choose ‘download’.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"./dea16.png\" alt=\"The DE Africa Sandbox Jupyterlab tutorial image.\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "After saving the GeoTIFF, return to the cell defining the latitude and longitude coordinates for analysis and choose another set. Then rerun the analysis and visualise the newly selected area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stretch Goal (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "The final stretch goal, if there is time remaining in the session, is to do a simple band index calculation, manually calculating NDVI. See the notebook for tips on how to do this.\n",
    "\n",
