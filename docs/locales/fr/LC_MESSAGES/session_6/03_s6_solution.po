"In Session 6, you used the case study framework to construct an analysis "
"on water extent. This involved using the Water Observations from Space "
"(WOfS) dataset. The WOfS dataset identifies water pixels, which you used "
"to calculate the area of water. The water extent was plotted next to an "
"RGB map of the same area."
