    "In Session 5, you looked at the framework of a case study. Building on elements from previous sessions &mdash; such as loading data, calculating an index, and plotting results &mdash; you used a new index, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), to show differences over time. This involved defining the area of interest using a buffer zone, and splitting the time range into half."
