"In Session 4, you created a notebook to load satellite products, resample"
" the data into quarterly segments, and then calculate and plot the "
"Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Combining bands into "
"indices such as NDVI can yield important insights into the data which "
"might not be apparent using true-color RGB imagery alone."
