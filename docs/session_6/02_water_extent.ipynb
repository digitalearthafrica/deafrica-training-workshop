    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will create a new notebook to determine the extent of water bodies using the [Water Observation from Space (WOfS) product](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/community-safety/flood/wofs/about-wofs). The WOfS product uses an automated water mapping algorithm to identify water in Landsat 8 images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will include the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load the WOfS feature layer product and Landsat 8 data\n",
    "* Identify water pixels from WOfS\n",
    "* Plot a true-colour image using Landsat data\n",
    "* Plot the water body area for the same area using WOfS data\n",
    "* Customise the plots\n",
    "\n",
    "At the conclusion of this exercise, you will be able to determine the extent of water bodies using the WOfS product."
