    "In Session 6, you used the case study framework to construct an analysis on water extent. This involved using the Water Observations from Space (WOfS) dataset. The WOfS dataset identifies water pixels, which you used to calculate the area of water. The water extent was plotted next to an RGB map of the same area."
