Session 4: Introduction
=======================

Welcome to the first session of the Digital Earth Africa training course! 

This session introduces the Digital Earth Africa program and shows you how to sign up to the Digital Earth Africa Sandbox, our data analysis platform. We will then walk through an exercise exploring crop health data.

It is not required to have previous experience in Earth observation data or Python coding. Every section includes instructions and screenshots on how to perform each task.
