    "In Session 3, you loaded Sentinel-2 data into the Sandbox using `load_ard()`. The first section of the exercise showed that `load_ard()` applies a cloud mask to each timestep in the dataset. The second part of the exercise used the same dataset to calculate and plot a cloud-free geomedian, using `xr_geomedian()` and `rgb()`."
